We have different eras of privacy research,

![Privacy eras](privacy)

We see that we have 8 different data concerns:

1. Data security: Customers fearing what happens with their data and how might get access to your data, e.g., from hacking.
2. Secretive data collection: That governments and companies are secretaely storing information about you.
3. Junk mail and spam: Some customers fear that entering personal information at webpages leads to all kinds of junk and spam mail.
4. Third-party access: That companies are leaking data third parties.
5. None of your business: This is about peopling feeling ownership of information and companies are not obliged to know, e.g., what books, movies etc. that a customer has been looking at.
6. Feelings of violation: This is a feeling after realizing seeing what information a company is holding. e.g., you accept that google can store your timeline, although when you actually look at this, you start feeling scared.
7. Inequitable exchange: This is basically that customer dont feel that the information they give, is returned in better adds and recommendations.
8. Fear of errors: Customers are afraid that the wrong information is stored on them.

We see that research has found that :

1. 17% are very concerned about websites collecting data and dont want to give any information.
2. 56% of customers are concerned about privacy but also feel it can be legislated through regulations.
3. 27% are only marginally afraid of companies knowing about their customers.

Another study generalize with the following:

Where we see that are four poles and most will find themselved somewhere inbetween.

Despite the research above, one can also find a discrepency between actual oppinions as most people do not read the privacy policies (40%), where they find that 70% of americans worry about privacy policy. Naturally this is different from country to country.
